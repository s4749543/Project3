This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the primary risks associated with a European call option on BHP stock, specifically Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho. The objective is to create a portfolio that is insensitive to small changes in the underlying asset price, volatility, interest rates, and time decay. The strategy employs a combination of the underlying BHP stock and two other European call options on BHP: a near-the-money option and an out-the-money option. The provided data outlines the optimal weights for each instrument in the hedging portfolio. A negative weight for the underlying stock signifies a short position (selling borrowed shares), while positive weights for the options indicate long positions (buying the options). The effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated by the significant reduction in the portfolio's Greeks post-hedging. The initial Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho of the original BHP option are nearly eliminated, as evidenced by the near-zero values after implementing the hedging strategy. This indicates that the portfolio's value will remain relatively stable in the face of market fluctuations.

The hedging strategy utilizes a combination of instruments to offset the risks inherent in the original BHP call option. Shorting the underlying BHP stock primarily addresses the Delta risk, which measures the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset price. Since the Delta of a stock is 1, a short position in BHP helps neutralize the positive Delta of the original call option. The two other options, near-the-money and out-the-money, are strategically included to mitigate Gamma, Vega, and Rho. Gamma, representing the rate of change of Delta, is addressed by utilizing options with opposing Gammas. Vega, measuring the sensitivity to changes in volatility, is hedged by selecting options with Vegas that offset the original optionâ€™s Vega. Rho, measuring the sensitivity to interest rate changes, is similarly addressed by choosing options with opposing Rhos. The specific weights assigned to these options are calculated to minimize the overall portfolio Greeks, effectively neutralizing the portfolio's sensitivity to market movements. The provided data demonstrates that the near-the-money option plays a more significant role in the hedge (higher weight) compared to the out-of-the-money option, likely due to its higher Gamma and Vega values, making it more effective in offsetting the corresponding risks.

While this hedging strategy effectively reduces the portfolio's sensitivities to market fluctuations, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. Firstly, the hedge is dynamic and requires frequent rebalancing. The optimal weights of the hedging instruments will change as the underlying stock price, volatility, and time to expiry fluctuate. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adjustment of the portfolio are necessary to maintain the desired level of hedge effectiveness. Secondly, the strategy assumes that the Greeks accurately represent the option's price sensitivities. In reality, these are approximations, and higher-order Greeks (like Vanna and Volga) can become significant under certain market conditions. The model also implicitly assumes a constant volatility and interest rate, which rarely holds true in practice. Fluctuations in these parameters can impact the hedge's effectiveness. Finally, transaction costs associated with rebalancing the hedge can erode profitability. Therefore, the frequency of rebalancing needs to be optimized to balance hedge accuracy with transaction costs. Despite these limitations, this hedging strategy represents a robust approach to mitigating the primary risks associated with a European call option, providing a more stable and predictable portfolio value.
