This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the price sensitivity of a European call option on BHP to changes in the underlying asset's price, volatility, interest rates, and time decay. The specific option being hedged is not explicitly defined but its sensitivities suggest it has a negative delta, gamma, vega, and rho. This implies it's likely a short or sold call option position. The hedging strategy utilizes a portfolio of three instruments: the underlying BHP stock, a near-the-money call option on BHP, and an out-the-money call option on BHP. Optimal weights for each instrument have been calculated to minimize the overall portfolio's Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) and bring them as close to zero as possible. This effectively creates a delta-neutral, gamma-neutral, vega-neutral, and rho-neutral position, thereby insulating the portfolio from market fluctuations. The goal is to eliminate the risk associated with the original short call option position.

The provided data shows the composition of the hedging portfolio and its effectiveness. The underlying BHP stock receives a small negative weight, implying a short position. The bulk of the hedge consists of long positions in both the near-the-money and out-the-money call options, with the former having a significantly larger allocation. This combination of long and short call options allows for fine-tuning of the portfolio's Greeks. The success of the hedge is demonstrated by the significant reduction in the absolute values of the portfolio's Greeks after implementing the strategy. The original negative Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho have been reduced to near-zero values, indicating a highly effective hedge. For example, the initial delta of -0.55 has been reduced to approximately zero, meaning the portfolio's value is now largely insensitive to small changes in the underlying stock price. Similar improvements are observed for Gamma, Vega, and Rho. This near-zero Greek profile signifies that the portfolio is effectively immunized against market risks associated with these parameters.

This hedging strategy utilizes the inherent relationships between the Greeks of different option contracts and the underlying asset. Delta hedging involves offsetting the delta of the short call option with a combination of long positions in other options and a small short position in the underlying stock. Gamma hedging, accomplished through the balanced use of different options, mitigates the risk of delta hedging becoming ineffective due to large price swings. Vega hedging utilizes the long options to offset the negative vega of the original short call, reducing sensitivity to volatility changes. Rho hedging addresses interest rate risk by creating a portfolio with a near-zero rho. However, this strategy has limitations. Transaction costs associated with trading the underlying stock and options can impact its effectiveness. The hedge also requires frequent rebalancing as the Greeks of the options change over time. Furthermore, the model assumes a constant volatility, which may not hold true in reality. Sudden volatility shifts could render the vega hedge less effective. Additionally, the strategy does not account for higher-order Greeks, which could contribute to risk in extreme market scenarios. Finally, the model's accuracy depends on the accuracy of the option pricing model used to calculate the Greeks. Deviations from the model's assumptions could lead to imperfect hedging.
