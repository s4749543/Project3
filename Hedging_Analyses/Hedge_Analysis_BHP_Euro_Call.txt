This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the risk associated with a European call option on BHP stock by creating a portfolio that is delta, gamma, vega, and rho neutral. This means the portfolio's value will be insensitive to small changes in the underlying stock price, volatility, time to expiry, and interest rates. The hedging strategy uses a combination of the underlying BHP stock, a near-the-money call option on BHP, and an out-the-money call option on BHP. The specific weights for each instrument are determined by an optimization process that minimizes the overall portfolio Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, and rho).

To implement this hedge, traders should follow these steps. First, determine the Greeks of the original European call option on BHP that needs to be hedged. Second, calculate the optimal weights for the hedging instruments using the provided information on the Greeks of the underlying stock and the two options. Specifically, the weights indicate the proportion of the portfolio that should be allocated to each instrument. A negative weight for the underlying stock implies short selling. For example, if the target hedge is for 100 of the original options, then approximately -4.95 shares of BHP should be sold short, 80.84 near-the-money call options should be bought long, and 19.53 out-the-money call options should be bought long. This combined position creates an offsetting portfolio that negates the sensitivities of the original call option. The effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated by the near-zero values of the portfolio's delta, gamma, vega, and rho post-hedging.

The provided data shows the original option has negative delta, gamma, vega, and rho. A negative delta indicates that the option price will decrease if the underlying stock price increases, while a negative gamma signifies that the delta's sensitivity to changes in the stock price is also negative, implying the hedge needs adjusting frequently. Negative vega signifies that the option price will decrease if volatility increases, and negative rho indicates a decrease in the option price if interest rates rise. By shorting the underlying stock, the hedge gains a positive delta and a zero gamma, which partially offsets the negative delta and gamma of the original option. Long positions in the near-the-money and out-the-money call options provide additional positive delta, positive gamma, positive vega, and positive rho. The specific combination of these instruments, determined by the optimal weights, counteracts the sensitivities of the original option, bringing the portfolio’s Greeks close to zero. This neutralization ensures minimal impact on the portfolio value due to small fluctuations in market conditions.

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of this strategy. First, this hedge is based on a linear approximation of the relationship between option prices and market parameters. Large market movements can invalidate these approximations, requiring adjustments to the hedge. Second, the hedge assumes constant Greeks, which is not realistic in practice. Regular rebalancing is therefore necessary to maintain the hedge’s effectiveness, introducing transaction costs. Third, the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments can affect the feasibility and cost of implementing the strategy. Finally, the model relies on accurate estimations of the Greeks, which are model-dependent and can be subject to error.
