This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the risks associated with a European call option on BHP stock, specifically targeting Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho. The strategy involves constructing a portfolio consisting of the underlying BHP stock and two other European call options on BHP: a near-the-money option and an out-of-the-money option. The objective is to determine the optimal weights of these three instruments that minimize the overall portfolio's sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset's price, volatility, interest rates, and time decay. For traders looking to implement this hedge, the process begins with calculating the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) for the original call option position and the two auxiliary options. The optimal hedging weights provided indicate the proportion of each instrument to hold in the portfolio. A negative weight for the underlying stock signals a short position (selling borrowed shares), while positive weights for the options indicate long positions (buying the options). For instance, a weight of -0.000495 for the underlying implies selling a small amount of BHP stock, while weights of 0.808351 and 0.195340 for the near- and out-of-the-money options respectively, indicate buying these options in those proportions. By combining these positions in the specified proportions, the overall portfolio's Greeks are significantly reduced, effectively neutralizing the risks associated with the original call option.

The output of the optimization process provides critical insights into the effectiveness of the hedge. The table displaying the original and post-hedging Greeks demonstrates a substantial reduction in the portfolio's sensitivities. For example, the initial Delta of -0.554001, representing a negative price sensitivity, is reduced to near zero (-7.942359e-09) after implementing the hedge. This near-zero Delta signifies that the portfolio's value will remain relatively stable even with small fluctuations in BHP's stock price. Similar reductions are observed for Gamma (curvature of the price-sensitivity), Vega (sensitivity to volatility), and Rho (sensitivity to interest rates). The minimal residual values post-hedging are attributed to numerical approximations in the optimization process and are practically negligible. The optimal weights of -0.000495, 0.808351, and 0.195340 for the underlying stock, near-the-money option, and out-the-money option, respectively, indicate the precise proportions required to achieve this risk minimization. These weights are derived by solving a system of equations that sets the weighted sum of the individual instrument's Greeks equal to zero (or as close to zero as possible). This effectively neutralizes the overall portfolio's sensitivity to changes in the market parameters being hedged.

The primary goal of this strategy is to hedge a European call option on BHP stock against adverse price movements, volatility changes, and interest rate fluctuations. The underlying BHP stock hedges the Delta, meaning it offsets the direct price risk of the original option. The near-the-money and out-of-the-money options are used primarily to hedge Gamma and Vega risks. They achieve this due to their different sensitivities to changes in the underlying price and volatility. Specifically, the near-the-money option, with its higher Gamma, helps to offset the non-linear price risk of the original option. The out-of-the-money option, with its relatively higher Vega, helps to neutralize the impact of volatility changes. The combination of these options allows for fine-tuning the hedge to address both second-order price risk and volatility risk simultaneously. Rho is also hedged by the combination of options and underlying stock, mitigating the impact of interest rate movements. However, this strategy assumes constant model parameters, which is a simplification. In reality, factors like volatility are dynamic and can significantly influence the effectiveness of the hedge over time. Consequently, regular recalibration of the hedge, including recomputing the Greeks and adjusting the portfolio weights, is crucial to maintain the desired level of risk mitigation. Furthermore, transaction costs associated with adjusting the hedge can erode profitability, and these should be considered during implementation. Finally,  perfect hedging is theoretically possible but practically challenging due to market imperfections, discrete hedging intervals, and the inherent limitations of the models used to estimate the Greeks.
