This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) of a European Basket Call Option composed of BHP (10%), CSL (35%), WDS (15%), and MQG (40%). The strategy utilizes a portfolio of instruments including the underlying basket of stocks, a near-the-money basket call option, an out-the-money basket call option, and a long-term basket call option. The optimal weights for these instruments, determined through an optimization process likely minimizing a risk measure related to the Greeks, are -0.000064, -0.980379, -0.050666, and -0.000130, respectively. The negative weights signify short positions, indicating that the hedging portfolio primarily involves selling these instruments. Specifically, the hedge leans heavily on selling near-the-money basket call options, suggesting that the dominant risk factor being addressed is the option's delta and gamma. The smaller allocations to shorting the out-the-money and long-term calls contribute to mitigating vega and rho risks, respectively. This combination of short positions aims to offset the positive Greeks of the original basket call option, effectively immunizing the portfolio against small changes in the underlying asset prices, volatility, and interest rates.

The provided data reveals the effectiveness of the hedging strategy. The original basket call option had a Delta of 0.156893, indicating a positive price sensitivity to changes in the underlying basket value. Post-hedging, the Delta is effectively reduced to near zero (-2.22e-09), demonstrating successful neutralization of this risk. Similarly, the Gamma, representing the rate of change of Delta, is reduced from 0.003704 to near zero (9.19e-07), implying that the hedged portfolio is less sensitive to large price swings in the underlying basket. The Vega, reflecting sensitivity to changes in implied volatility, is also brought close to zero (-1.88e-08), down from 0.208701. Finally, the Rho, representing sensitivity to interest rate changes, is minimized from 0.140208 to approximately zero (2.77e-08). These results suggest that the hedging strategy has effectively mitigated the primary market risks associated with the basket call option. The hedging objective is to minimize the portfolio's sensitivity to market fluctuations, thereby creating a position that is less susceptible to losses arising from adverse movements in the underlying assets, volatility, or interest rates.

It's important to acknowledge the limitations of this hedging strategy. Firstly, the effectiveness of the hedge relies on the accuracy of the Greek calculations and the assumptions underlying the pricing model used. Model risk is inherent in any hedging strategy and deviations from model assumptions can lead to imperfect hedging. Secondly, this is a static hedge, meaning the optimal weights are calculated at a specific point in time. As market conditions change, the effectiveness of the hedge will erode, necessitating periodic rebalancing. Transaction costs associated with rebalancing can impact overall profitability. Furthermore, the hedging strategy assumes liquid markets for all instruments in the portfolio. If any of the instruments become illiquid, it may be difficult or costly to adjust the hedge. Finally, the effectiveness of hedging Vega depends critically on the model's accuracy in predicting implied volatility movements. If realized volatility deviates significantly from implied volatility, the hedge may not perform as expected.
