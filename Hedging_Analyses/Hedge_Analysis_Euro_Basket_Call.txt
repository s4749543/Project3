This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) of a European Basket Call Option composed of BHP (10%), CSL (35%), WDS (15%), and MQG (40%). The strategy constructs a portfolio consisting of the underlying basket of stocks, a near-the-money basket call, an out-the-money basket call, and a long-term basket call. Optimal weights for each instrument in the hedging portfolio are determined to minimize the overall Greeks of the combined position. This is effectively a delta-neutral hedging strategy, extended to also account for gamma, vega, and rho, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the option's value to changes in the underlying asset prices, volatility, and interest rates. The provided data indicates the calculated optimal weights for each instrument: a short position in the underlying basket, a significant short position in the near-the-money basket call, a smaller short position in the out-the-money basket call, and a negligible short position in the long-term basket call.

The output tables present crucial information for evaluating the hedging strategy's effectiveness. The first table displays the Greeks for each individual instrument, highlighting their sensitivities. For instance, the near-the-money call exhibits the highest Delta and Gamma amongst the options, signifying its greater sensitivity to underlying price movements. The Vega values illustrate the options' sensitivity to volatility changes, with the long-term call having the highest Vega, reflecting its longer exposure to potential volatility fluctuations. Rho values indicate interest rate sensitivity. The second table shows the original and post-hedging Greeks of the basket call option. The significant reduction in Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho post-hedging demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategy in mitigating the option's sensitivities to market risks. The post-hedging values, close to zero, indicate a near-perfect hedge, meaning the value of the hedged portfolio will remain relatively stable despite market fluctuations.

The strategy primarily hedges against four key market risks: price risk (Delta), convexity risk (Gamma), volatility risk (Vega), and interest rate risk (Rho). By minimizing these Greeks, the strategy aims to protect the option seller from adverse market movements. The short positions in the underlying basket and the other call options offset the long position's sensitivities, creating a more neutral overall position. However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations. This static hedge assumes constant Greeks, which is unrealistic in dynamic markets. Consequently, regular rebalancing is required to maintain the hedge's effectiveness as market conditions change. Transaction costs associated with rebalancing can erode the hedge's profitability. Furthermore, the effectiveness relies on accurate pricing models for the options and the underlying basket. Model risk, arising from inaccurate model assumptions, can also compromise the hedge. Finally, this strategy primarily addresses linear risks and might not fully capture non-linear risks, especially under extreme market conditions.
