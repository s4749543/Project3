This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the Greek exposures (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) of a European Basket Call Option composed of 10% BHP, 35% CSL, 15% WDS, and 40% MQG. The strategy constructs a portfolio consisting of the underlying basket of stocks, a near-the-money basket call option, an out-the-money basket call option, and a long-term basket call option. The optimal weights for each instrument in the hedging portfolio are determined by minimizing the overall Greek exposures of the combined position (original option + hedging portfolio). Specifically, the strategy seeks to find the quantities of each instrument that, when combined with the original basket call, result in a net Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho close to zero.

To implement this hedge, traders should first calculate the Greek sensitivities of the original basket call option. This involves determining the option's price sensitivity to changes in the underlying basket price (Delta), changes in the rate of change of the underlying basket price (Gamma), changes in implied volatility (Vega), and changes in the risk-free interest rate (Rho). These calculations can be performed using standard option pricing models adapted for basket options. Next, traders need the Greek sensitivities for the hedging instruments: the underlying basket, the near-the-money basket call, the out-the-money basket call, and the long-term basket call. With these Greeks in hand, traders can apply the determined optimal weights to calculate the required position size for each hedging instrument. For instance, a weight of -0.000098 for the underlying basket implies a short position in the basket equivalent to 0.000098 times the notional value of the original basket call. Similarly, a weight of 0.980850 for the near-the-money basket call indicates a long position in this option equivalent to 0.980850 times the original call's notional value. By taking these offsetting positions according to the calculated weights, the trader aims to construct a portfolio that is largely insensitive to market fluctuations.

The provided data demonstrates the effectiveness of this hedging strategy. The original basket call option exhibited significant Greek exposures, including a negative Delta of -0.156893, a negative Gamma of -0.003704, a negative Vega of -0.208701, and a negative Rho of -0.140208. After implementing the hedging strategy, the overall portfolio's Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho were reduced drastically, approaching zero. This indicates that the hedging portfolio successfully neutralized the original option's sensitivities to underlying price movements, volatility changes, and interest rate fluctuations. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this approach. This static hedge assumes constant Greeks, which is unrealistic in practice. As market conditions change, the Greek sensitivities of both the original option and the hedging instruments will evolve, requiring frequent rebalancing of the hedge. This rebalancing introduces transaction costs, potentially impacting the overall effectiveness of the strategy. Moreover, the accuracy of the hedge depends on the accuracy of the calculated Greeks and the chosen option pricing model. Model risk, stemming from potential misspecifications or limitations of the pricing model, can lead to imperfect hedging. Finally, this specific hedge utilizes options with different maturities and strike prices. Maintaining liquidity in all these instruments might be challenging, especially for customized basket options, which could further complicate the hedging process. Therefore, ongoing monitoring and adjustments are essential for managing the dynamic nature of market risks and ensuring the continued efficacy of the hedge.
