This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) of a European Basket Call Option composed of BHP (10%), CSL (35%), WDS (15%), and MQG (40%). The strategy employs a portfolio of three other basket call options with varying characteristics: a near-the-money, an out-the-money, and a long-term basket call option, in addition to the underlying basket of stocks itself. The objective is to construct a combined position where the weighted sum of the Greeks of the individual components offsets the Greeks of the original basket call option, thereby minimizing the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset prices, volatility, and interest rates.

To implement this hedge, traders should first calculate the optimal weights for each instrument in the hedging portfolio. This involves determining the proportion of each instrument that, when combined with the original basket call option (assigned a weight of -1), minimizes the overall Greek exposures. The provided optimal weights indicate a short position in the underlying basket (-0.000098), a long position in the near-the-money basket call (0.980850), a smaller long position in the out-the-money basket call (0.040431), and a negligible short position in the long-term basket call (-0.000116). These weights dictate the relative size of each position needed to achieve the hedge. For example, for every unit of the original basket call option being hedged, a trader should hold approximately 0.98 units of the near-the-money basket call. This process effectively constructs a portfolio whose aggregate Greeks approach zero. In practical terms, a trader would determine the notional value of their original basket call position and then multiply that value by each optimal weight to calculate the corresponding notional values for each of the hedging instruments. These calculated notional values then inform the number of contracts or shares to buy or sell for each instrument, achieving the desired hedge ratios.

The output of the hedging strategy demonstrates its effectiveness. The original basket call option had a negative Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho, indicating sensitivity to downward price movements, changes in the rate of price change, volatility, and interest rates, respectively. After implementing the hedge, these values are reduced by several orders of magnitude, effectively neutralizing the portfolio's sensitivity to these market factors. The "Post-Hedging (Minimized)" values, being close to zero, represent the residual risk after applying the hedge. This residual risk arises because a perfect hedge is often difficult to achieve in practice due to market imperfections, discrete trading units, and dynamic market conditions. The success of the hedge is reflected in the significant reduction of the Greeks, indicating a substantially lower risk profile.

This strategy primarily hedges against market risk, specifically the risk associated with changes in the underlying asset prices (Delta), changes in the rate of price change (Gamma), implied volatility (Vega), and interest rates (Rho). By minimizing these Greeks, the strategy seeks to protect the portfolio value from adverse market movements. However, the strategy has limitations. It assumes that the Greeks remain constant, which is not the case in reality. As market conditions change, the Greeks will shift, requiring frequent rebalancing of the hedging portfolio to maintain effectiveness. This dynamic hedging introduces transaction costs, which can erode profitability. Furthermore, the model's accuracy depends on the precision of the Greek calculations and the availability of suitable hedging instruments. If the model's assumptions are inaccurate or appropriate hedging instruments are unavailable, the effectiveness of the hedge will be compromised. Finally, this strategy primarily addresses market risk, leaving the portfolio exposed to other risks such as counterparty risk and liquidity risk, which should be managed separately. The strategy is also sensitive to the accurate modeling of correlations between the constituents of the basket. Inaccuracies in these correlations can reduce the hedgeâ€™s effectiveness significantly. Continuous monitoring and adjustment are crucial for maintaining an effective hedge in a dynamic market environment.
