This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) of a European Basket Call Option composed of BHP, CSL, WDS, and MQG. The strategy constructs a portfolio of other basket call options with varying characteristics – near-the-money, out-the-money, and long-term – and the underlying basket itself. By combining these instruments in specific proportions (optimal weights), the overall portfolio's sensitivity to underlying price movements, volatility changes, and interest rate fluctuations is minimized. This effectively creates a delta-neutral, gamma-neutral, vega-neutral, and rho-neutral position, protecting the investor from potential losses arising from adverse market movements. The optimal weights represent the quantity of each instrument to hold, with negative weights indicating short positions.

The provided data reveals the effectiveness of the hedging strategy. Initially, the original basket call option exhibited significant sensitivity to underlying price changes (Delta: -0.1569), convexity (Gamma: -0.0037), volatility (Vega: -0.2087), and interest rates (Rho: -0.1402). After implementing the hedge, these sensitivities are drastically reduced to near-zero values (Delta: -9.15e-08, Gamma: 6.52e-07, Vega: -1.58e-07, Rho: 1.88e-07), demonstrating successful neutralization. The table detailing the Greeks of each individual instrument provides insights into their contribution to the overall hedge. For instance, the near-the-money basket call exhibits relatively high Delta, Gamma, and Vega, making it a crucial component for offsetting the original option's sensitivities. The long-term basket call, with its high Vega and Rho, primarily addresses volatility and interest rate risks. The optimal weights highlight the importance of each instrument in the hedging portfolio. The near-the-money call has the highest positive weight, followed by the out-the-money call, while the underlying basket and long-term call have negligible negative weights, indicating small short positions.

This strategy primarily hedges against market risks associated with the underlying basket's price movements, volatility, and interest rate changes. By minimizing the Greeks, the investor effectively locks in the option's value, irrespective of short-term market fluctuations. However, several limitations exist. Firstly, this strategy assumes constant implied volatility and interest rates, which are unrealistic assumptions in dynamic markets. Secondly, the hedge requires continuous monitoring and adjustment as the underlying basket's price and market conditions change. This rebalancing incurs transaction costs, potentially impacting profitability. Thirdly, the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments are crucial for successful implementation. If these instruments are illiquid or unavailable, the hedge may be difficult or expensive to construct. Finally, this specific model utilizes a linear approximation of the Greeks, which may not accurately capture the non-linear behavior of option prices in extreme market conditions. Therefore, while this strategy offers valuable risk mitigation, it is crucial to acknowledge its limitations and consider alternative hedging approaches in specific market contexts.
