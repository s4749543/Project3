This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the risk associated with an American put option on CBA (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) stock by creating a portfolio that offsets the option's sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset's price (Delta), price volatility (Vega), interest rates (Rho), and the rate of change of Delta (Gamma). This is achieved by taking positions in other instruments whose Greeks (sensitivity measures) have opposite signs to the original put option, effectively minimizing the overall portfolio's exposure to market fluctuations. For a trader looking to implement this hedge, the process involves calculating the optimal weights of each hedging instrument and then taking positions proportional to these weights. The output provided demonstrates the effectiveness of this hedging strategy.

Specifically, the strategy uses a combination of the underlying CBA stock, a near-the-money option, an out-of-the-money option, and a short-term option to hedge the original American put. The optimal weights for each instrument, as determined by an optimization algorithm, are 5.97% for the underlying stock, 35.90% for the near-the-money option, 29.65% for the out-of-the-money option, and 42.56% for the short-term option. These weights dictate the relative size of the positions to be taken in each instrument. For instance, a trader hedging a put option with a notional value of $1 million would invest approximately $60,000 in CBA stock, $359,000 in the near-the-money option, $296,500 in the out-of-the-money option, and $425,600 in the short-term option. The "Post-Hedging (Minimized)" values demonstrate the effectiveness of the hedge. The near-zero values for Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho post-hedging indicate a significant reduction in the portfolio's sensitivity to these risk factors. The original option had a negative Vega and a positive Rho. These values indicate that the value of the option would decrease as volatility decreases and increase as interest rates increase. The hedging strategy used short-term and out-of-the-money options, which have positive Vegas, to offset this. Because these options have a high Vega, the weight allocated to these were high. Similar logic applies to hedging the Rho.

The choice of instruments is driven by their respective Greek profiles. The underlying stock is used to manage Delta risk. Holding a long position in the underlying asset offsets the negative Delta of the put option. Near-the-money options exhibit high Gamma and Vega, making them suitable for hedging these risks. Out-of-the-money options have a relatively high Vega for a lower premium, offering a cost-effective way to hedge Vega risk. Finally, short-term options have higher Gamma and lower Vega, which are useful for fine-tuning the hedge. While this strategy significantly mitigates risks, it has limitations. Firstly, it assumes the Greeks remain constant, which is unrealistic in dynamic markets. Regular rebalancing is required to maintain hedge effectiveness as market conditions change. Secondly, the model relies on accurately pricing the options, which can be complex, especially for American options. Model misspecifications or inaccurate volatility estimations can impact the hedge's performance. Thirdly, transaction costs associated with rebalancing the portfolio can erode profitability. Finally, hedging Gamma perfectly is challenging and often involves a trade-off with Vega hedging. This strategy addresses the key risks associated with an American put option, providing a robust framework for risk management. However, traders must be aware of its limitations and actively monitor and adjust the hedge as needed to maintain its effectiveness.
