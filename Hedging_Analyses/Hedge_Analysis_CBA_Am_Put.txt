This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the price sensitivity of an American put option on CBA (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) stock to various market risk factors. Specifically, it seeks to minimize the option's exposure to changes in the underlying stock price (Delta), changes in the rate of change of the underlying price (Gamma), changes in implied volatility (Vega), and changes in interest rates (Rho). The strategy employs a portfolio of financial instruments, including the underlying CBA stock, a near-the-money option, an out-the-money option, and a short-term option, to offset the original put option's sensitivities to these risk factors. By optimally weighting these instruments, the strategy constructs a hedge portfolio that effectively minimizes the overall Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho of the combined position. The goal is to create a position that is as close to risk-neutral as possible, thereby protecting the investor from adverse market movements. This allows the trader holding the option to isolate profits to directional views if the hedge is dynamically updated, while minimizing the risk to unwanted directional price movements.

The provided data reveals the effectiveness of the hedging strategy. The initial, or "Original", values represent the risk exposures of the unhedged American put option. A negative Delta indicates that the option's value will decrease as the underlying stock price increases, which is typical for a put option. Similarly, a negative Gamma means that the rate of change of the option's Delta will decrease as the stock price increases, implying a convexity profile. The negative Vega signifies that the option's value will decline if implied volatility decreases, as expected for options. The positive Rho suggests that the option's value will increase as interest rates rise. After implementing the hedging strategy, the "Post-Hedging (Minimized)" values demonstrate a significant reduction in all risk exposures. The near-zero values for Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho indicate that the hedge portfolio has effectively neutralized the sensitivities of the original put option. The optimal weights assigned to each instrument in the hedging portfolio reveal their relative importance in achieving the desired risk reduction. The underlying stock, near-the-money option, out-the-money option, and short-term option each contribute to offsetting different aspects of the original option's risk profile, with varying effectiveness.

This strategy primarily hedges market risks associated with the underlying asset, CBA stock, as well as volatility and interest rate risks impacting the option price. The chosen instruments contribute specifically to mitigate each of these risks. The underlying stock is used to offset Delta risk. The near-the-money option, with its higher Gamma, is primarily used to offset the Gamma risk of the original put option, countering changes in Delta. The out-the-money option, more sensitive to changes in implied volatility due to its higher Vega, is used to offset the original option's Vega risk. Finally, the short-term option, with its lower Rho and Vega, is used to fine-tune the hedge against interest rate risk and time decay. The varying sensitivities of these instruments to the four Greek letters allow for constructing a portfolio that, when combined with appropriate weights, minimizes overall risk exposure. A limitation of this strategy is the requirement for continuous monitoring and adjustment. Market conditions are dynamic, necessitating regular recalibration of hedge ratios (weights) and potentially the composition of hedging instruments to maintain effectiveness. Transaction costs associated with frequent adjustments can also diminish overall returns. Furthermore, the model's accuracy is dependent on the reliability of the Greek values used. Inaccuracies in these estimations can lead to imperfect hedging and residual exposures. This strategy also assumes continuous delta hedging is possible, but markets don't allow for continuous trading, which may leave the trader exposed to unhedged risks. Finally, the model assumes that the option valuation model is correctly specified and other factors not captured in the model, such as sudden changes in market sentiment or liquidity shocks, can impact the effectiveness of the hedge.
