This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the risks associated with an American Put option on CBA (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) stock by creating a portfolio of offsetting positions. Specifically, the strategy seeks to minimize the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset's price (Delta), changes in Delta (Gamma), changes in implied volatility (Vega), and changes in interest rates (Rho). The primary objective is to create a delta-neutral, gamma-neutral, vega-neutral, and rho-neutral portfolio, effectively insulating the option's value from market fluctuations.

To execute this strategy, traders should construct a portfolio consisting of the underlying CBA stock, a near-the-money put option on CBA, an out-the-money put option on CBA, and a short-term put option on CBA. The provided analysis has determined the optimal weights for each instrument in the hedging portfolio. These weights, expressed as percentages of the original option position, dictate the proportion of each instrument required to achieve the desired hedge. Specifically, traders should hold 5.97% of the underlying CBA stock, short 35.90% of a near-the-money put option, short 29.65% of an out-the-money put option, and short 42.56% of a short-term put option. Shorting these options generates positive Delta, Gamma, Vega and Rho, which offsets the negative Delta, Gamma, Vega and Rho of the American Put option. The underlying stock is included as it has a delta value of 1 and is not sensitive to changes in volatility, time, or interest rates - providing a cleaner tool for managing the portfolio Delta without impacting the other Greeks. The selection of different option types (near-the-money, out-the-money, short-term) allows for fine-tuning the hedge across the various risk parameters. Near-the-money options generally have higher Gamma and Vega, making them useful for managing these sensitivities. Out-the-money options offer higher leverage and sensitivity to Vega and Rho. Short-term options help mitigate the impact of time decay and are effective tools for Gamma management. By combining these instruments in specific proportions, the portfolioâ€™s overall Greek sensitivities are minimized.

The provided data demonstrates the effectiveness of the hedging strategy. The "Original CBA Option" row displays the Greek sensitivities of the initial American put option position. The "Post-Hedging (Minimized)" row shows the resulting sensitivities after implementing the hedging strategy. The near-zero values for Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho in the post-hedging scenario indicate a successful hedge. The strategy effectively neutralizes the portfolio's exposure to market fluctuations. This analysis confirms that the chosen weights of the underlying stock and the various option contracts effectively offset the risks associated with the original American put option. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this strategy. The analysis relies on a static snapshot of market conditions and assumes constant Greek values. In reality, these values change dynamically with market movements, requiring frequent rebalancing of the hedge portfolio. Transaction costs associated with rebalancing can erode the effectiveness of the hedge. Furthermore, the model assumes that the options are European-style, meaning they can only be exercised at expiration. The American-style nature of the original option adds complexity due to the possibility of early exercise, which isn't fully accounted for in this static hedging approach. Therefore, continuous monitoring and adjustments are essential for maintaining the desired level of hedge effectiveness.
