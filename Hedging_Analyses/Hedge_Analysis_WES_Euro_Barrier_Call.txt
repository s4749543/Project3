This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the primary Greek exposures—Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho—of a European Up-and-In Barrier Call option on WES stock. This specific barrier option becomes active (or "knocks in") only if the underlying WES stock price reaches a predetermined barrier level during the option's lifetime. Before the barrier is breached, the option has no value. Because of this unique characteristic, hedging a barrier option is dynamic and complex compared to vanilla options. The objective of this strategy is to minimize the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in the underlying stock price (Delta), the rate of change of Delta (Gamma), implied volatility (Vega), and interest rates (Rho). By effectively hedging these Greeks, the strategy seeks to protect the portfolio from unexpected losses stemming from market fluctuations and create a more predictable profit and loss profile.

The hedging strategy employs a portfolio of four instruments: the underlying WES stock, a near-the-money barrier call, an out-the-money barrier call, and a short-term barrier call. Specific weights are assigned to each instrument to achieve the desired hedge. The underlying stock is assigned a negative weight (-0.39), implying a short position. Shorting the underlying stock partially offsets the long Delta exposure of the original barrier option. The near-the-money barrier call receives a positive weight (0.50), contributing to the overall Delta and Vega hedge while also impacting Gamma. The out-the-money barrier call is assigned a large negative weight (-1.98). This instrument primarily impacts Vega and Rho, helping to reduce the portfolio's sensitivity to implied volatility changes and interest rate movements. Finally, the short-term barrier call, with a significantly positive weight (6.66), plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho hedges. The selection of these instruments, along with the calculated optimal weights, are derived from a quantitative optimization process that minimizes the portfolio's Greek exposures. To implement this hedge, traders would sell short 39 shares of WES for every 100 original barrier call options held. Simultaneously, they would buy 50 near-the-money barrier calls, sell 198 out-of-the-money barrier calls, and buy 666 short-term barrier calls. The provided analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the hedge by showing a significant reduction in the portfolio's Greeks post-hedging. The near-zero values for Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho after implementing the strategy indicate a successful neutralization of the original option's risk exposures.

However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations of this hedging strategy. Firstly, the hedge is based on a static point-in-time calculation of the Greeks. In reality, market conditions are dynamic, and the Greeks of both the original option and the hedging instruments will change continuously. This necessitates frequent recalibration of the hedge, involving adjusting the weights of the hedging instruments to maintain the desired level of risk mitigation. The effectiveness of the hedge is also contingent on the accuracy of the Greek calculations and the availability of liquid markets for the hedging instruments. In practice, there might be challenges in accurately pricing and trading barrier options, especially less liquid ones. Lastly, the hedge does not account for higher-order Greeks or potential jumps in the underlying asset price. These factors can introduce residual risks that are not fully captured by the Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho hedges. Therefore, while this strategy significantly reduces the market risks associated with the original up-and-in barrier call, ongoing monitoring, adjustment, and awareness of its limitations are crucial for successful risk management.
