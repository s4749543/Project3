This hedging strategy aims to neutralize the Greek sensitivities (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Rho) of a European Up-and-In Barrier Call option on WES. These sensitivities represent the option's exposure to changes in the underlying asset's price, volatility, time, and interest rates, respectively. Unhedged, these exposures can lead to significant and unpredictable profit or loss fluctuations. The strategy constructs a portfolio consisting of the underlying WES stock and three other barrier call options with varying characteristics – near-the-money, out-the-money, and short-term – to offset the original option's Greeks. The optimal weights for each instrument in the hedging portfolio are determined through an optimization process that minimizes the overall Greek exposure. The goal is to create a position that is, as much as possible, immune to market movements, effectively locking in the current value of the Up-and-In Barrier Call.

The provided outputs demonstrate the effectiveness of the hedging strategy. The table displaying the original and post-hedging Greeks clearly shows a significant reduction in all sensitivities. The Delta, initially -0.481243, is reduced to near zero, signifying that the hedged portfolio's value will be largely unaffected by small changes in the underlying WES stock price. Similarly, the substantial reduction in Gamma, from -0.304134 to near zero, indicates a decreased sensitivity to the rate of change in the underlying price. The near-zero Vega post-hedging suggests that the portfolio's value is now insulated from changes in implied volatility. Finally, the reduction in Rho to near zero minimizes the impact of interest rate fluctuations. The table of optimal weights indicates the proportion of each instrument to hold in the hedging portfolio. For instance, a positive weight for the underlying stock and the near-the-money barrier call implies long positions, while the negative weights for the out-the-money and short-term barrier calls suggest short positions. These weights are derived to achieve the desired Greek neutrality.

The strategy specifically hedges against the risks arising from the four key Greeks: Delta (price risk), Gamma (change in Delta risk), Vega (volatility risk), and Rho (interest rate risk). The underlying stock is used to primarily offset Delta exposure. The different barrier call options, each with unique characteristics, are strategically employed to counter the remaining Greeks. For example, near-the-money options generally have higher Gamma and Vega than out-of-the-money options, allowing for fine-tuning of the hedge. Short-term options, due to their shorter time to expiry, offer different sensitivities to Vega and Rho, further enhancing the hedge's effectiveness. By combining these instruments in specific proportions, the strategy attempts to neutralize the overall Greek exposure of the original Up-and-In Barrier Call. However, it's important to acknowledge the limitations. Barrier options can exhibit discontinuous price behavior around the barrier level, making precise hedging challenging. Furthermore, the hedge relies on the accurate estimation of the Greeks, which can be model-dependent and subject to error. Moreover, the hedge requires continuous monitoring and adjustment as market conditions change and the Greeks of the underlying and hedging instruments evolve. Transaction costs associated with rebalancing the portfolio can also erode the hedge's effectiveness. Finally, perfect hedging is theoretically impossible, and some residual risk will always remain.
